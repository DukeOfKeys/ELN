# GGN Great Great Numbers (_or something like that_)
Simple and ready to use C library for manipulations with big integers. I want not only to create lib for big numbers, I want to build decentralized network for computing different hard problems.
## TODO:
1. Add negative numbers, substraction devision
2. Move to another way of representation of big numbers, now i use char to represent only one number but it can represent even more if i manage to move to binary representation of numbers and binary calculation.
3. And many more
